# I-Phish
Instagram phishing tool made with Chat GPT prompts.


I-Phish is an instagram phishing tool that runs via flask to display the instagram login page on port 5000. 
A different service like NGROK or SSH can be used to deliver this malicious link by running the servers on the same port.
There are some changes to be made to this version and issues will be opened for these changes and they will be rectified in the next version along with a possibility of adding more social media website login pages to this tool.

This tool has been publically licensed.
